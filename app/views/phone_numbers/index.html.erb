  Now, make view table-less. Put focus on incoming number and who it is 
  assigned to. Upon click, reveal editable things like forwarding number 
  and voicemail. 

  Next, wire up the actual editing of the number. Once the edit page is 
  no longer necessary, turn the show action into some kind of dashboard
  for the incoming number. Some simple editable stuff, like forwarding
  on or off, as well as a voicemail player, recent calls, and ability
  to dial out from the web browser.

  Question is, what should that page be modelled after? Doesn't have to
  be a traditional phone â€” dialing is no longer necessary - but what
  instead?
